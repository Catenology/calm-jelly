Excerpt

### Background

Visual Studio is fully-featured integrated development environment (IDE) for Android, iOS, Windows, web, and cloud. Visual Studio provides the most powerful and feature complete development environment, bar none. Its complexity is intimidating and the framework it’s built on presents challenges akin to moving mountains just to make the slightest change to any of its components. Visual Studio has 4 million users with 1.5 billion revenue per year.

A breakpoint is a signal that tells the debugger to temporarily suspend execution of your program at a certain point. Breakpoints provide a powerful tool that enables you to suspend execution where and when you need to. Rather than stepping through your code line by line or instruction by instruction, you can allow your program to run until it hits a breakpoint, and then start to debug. This speeds up the debugging process. Without this ability, it would be almost impossible to debug a large program. Overall, breakpoint is very important for developers.

### The problems of current experience

The slideshows on the right clearly demonstrate the top problems for current breakpoint experience.

- It’s difficult to set up multiple conditions and actions
- The popups are modal and cover the most important code
- The advance features are undiscoverable

### The design goal for new experience

Make the breakpoint experience more
- Usable
- Discoverable
- Extensible

### Target Persona
