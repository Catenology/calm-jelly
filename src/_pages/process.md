A good design cannot be achieved without a good design process.

The first step to toggle a design challenge is to deeply understand the problem space. We need to get clear about the following questions: Who are we designing for? What are we trying to achieve? Why do users need it? What constraints do we have? What already exist? What are the measurements of being successful?

After understanding the problem space, the next step is to explore different design ideas. Quickly sketching multiple concepts is important at this stage since it is rare that a first idea ends up being the best idea.

Design is a process of making close approximations, the closest possible, to these idealistic desires. Quickly validate different early design ideas with the users and adapt the design based on the feedback until final design solution is found.

As well as creating final deliverables like redlines and visual spec, it is also a good idea to meet with the engineering team to walk them through the design and answer any questions. Another good practice is to review the ongoing implementation regularly to ensure the right experience is being built.

While this is the end of the segment of the product development lifecycle that is lead by design, it’s not the end of design involvement. After the implementation is completed, that’s another great moment for us to user test in order to inform the direction of the next design-measure-learn iteration.
